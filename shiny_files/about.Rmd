# About
  
## Purpose
  
This project seeks to do a comprehensive review of NCAA's efforts to publicize its men's and women's Division I sports teams via various official NCAA affiliated Twitter accounts in the 2018-2019 academic year. The research is centered around the questions: Does the NCAA provide equal media coverage its men's and women's sports teams? If not, which teams are favored? Are those teams favored due to a gender bias or greater team success than others? 
  
## The Data  
  
The data was gathered through the R package "Rtweets", accessed through a Twitter Developer account and relevant API's.
