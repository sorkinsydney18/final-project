# NCAA Twitter Analysis

The purpose of the project is to analyze and display how different NCAA Twitter accounts use their platform to relay news to followers. This project is tasked with answering the question of whether there is an imbalance of tweets dedicated to Men's or Women's team and athletes. Women's sports have been historically underrepresented in the media in turn damaging the visibility and growth of the women's game. Recent campaigns from top-tier brands like Nike or Adidas have recognized the imbalance of media coverage and sought to equalize. Twitter represents just one platform in which the NCAA can promote its sports teams. Is there a difference for how the NCAA reports Men's and Women's teams? If so, does this highlight a larger gender bias?
